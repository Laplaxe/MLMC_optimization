Code and data for the paper "Demonstrating Real Advantage of Machine-Learning-Enhanced Monte Carlo for Combinatorial Optimization".

- The Code directory contains code to run the optimization algorithms. In particular, the Legacy subdirectory contains supporting code, while Modern/optimization contains the code to perform Simulated, Population and Global Annealing.
- The Data directory conntains the data supporting the results in the paper. The Alpha subdirectory contains the spin interaction files (saved as "spin1 spin2 interaction"), while the Omega subdirectory contains the results of the runs of the annealings
- The Plots directory contains the both the code for producing the plots and the plots themselves.
